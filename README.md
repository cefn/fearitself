## Sticker advertisements and Fly Posting legislation

The sticker advertisements are not fly-posting, but are legal notices under "deemed consent". 

The relevant legislation is [The Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/783/pdfs/uksi_20070783_en.pdf)

It allows for advertisements falling into the description provided in Schedule 3 Part 1. In particular, our notices fall under the following specification...

"Class 2 Miscellaneous advertisements relating to the premises on which they are displayed Description 2A. An advertisement displayed for the purpose of identification, direction or warning, with respect to the land or building on which it is displayed."
